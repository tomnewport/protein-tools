# Roadmap for Protein Tools

Tom Newport, 2014

## 0.6a 

## 0.5a Demonstration using PNEP sequences

## 0.4a Fully automated pipeline

## 0.3a Basic demonstration of web interface

The web interface should be able to display structure predictions for a single protein to demonstrate the output of the system.

### TODO

- Better zoom/pan behaviour
- Rewrite slider bar using d3.js
- Better domain visualisation
- Better axis legends
- Show secondary structure with sequence
- Correct sequence colouring
